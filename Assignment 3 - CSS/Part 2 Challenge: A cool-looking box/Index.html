In this challenge, you will create a cool-looking box using CSS. You'll set its width (200px), center it, and adjust the font size using `rem`. Then, you'll add a background color, contrasting text color, and a black text shadow. To enhance the look, you'll apply a border-radius, a subtle border, and a linear gradient. Finally, you'll use multiple box shadows to create a 3D effect.

    For this assignment, Eileen Dover, a potential PhD candidate, will be marking up an official letter from Dr. Eleanor Gaye of the University of Awesome. Addressing the student's application, the letter offers details on research topics, start dates, and other areas of interest. In order to improve readability and semantic meaning, it incorporates organized HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to properly arrange the text. The project places a strong emphasis on using HTML correctly for professional letter style and organization.

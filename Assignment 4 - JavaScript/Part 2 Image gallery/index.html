This Image Gallery, which is driven by JavaScript, lets users change a darkening effect while dynamically displaying photos. The script initially loops through a list of potential text and picture filenames to fill a thumbnail bar. The matching selection is added to the main displayed image when you click on a thumbnail. A button also modifies the backdrop opacity of the primary picture to activate a dark overlay effect. Event listeners manage user interactions, guaranteeing seamless transitions and updates. Basic JavaScript ideas like loops, event handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic are reinforced in this project.
